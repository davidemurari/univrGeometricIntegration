- If you do not have the computer setup to work with Python scripts and notebooks, you can open the notebooks from this page, and click on the button ![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) appearing on each of them. You will then access Google Colab which allows to run the code without having to do anything locally.
